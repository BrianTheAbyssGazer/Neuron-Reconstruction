It takes about 1 day to run the whole process (I'm using Gforce 1080), so you may just want to look at the outcome at: https://youtu.be/hjQsEM5q8Mc
If you really want to run it by your self, run files in this order:
3d_pattern_generation.ipynb
segmentation3d.ipynb
Medial_axis_3d.ipynb
skeleton_analysis.ipynb
